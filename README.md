# The-Adventure-of-Phu
An android game application built in java. 
The app aims to address the some of the most important characteristics that make an app addictive for the users to keep coming back to it.

###	Game Plot :
-	Join Phu in his adventurous journey of skydiving. Help him avoid obstacles and land safely by navigating his way through the clouds.

###	Features of the app: 
-	Motion sensing to move around the game character (Phu)
-	Screens to play the game, view scores, change preferences

###	Features that increase user engagement :
-	Simple and intuitive controls: 
To navigate Phu through the sky, you simply have to tilt your phone in the direction you want the parachute to move.

###	Interactive endless gameplay: 
- The game never ends and you can keep steering through the sky. The score is based on how far you are able to keep Phu in the air without crashing.

###	Error Correction:
- Facilitates users to correct their perception in the gameplay by allowing them to continue playing after a minor hit with an obstacle: Since its an endless game, having to restart because of a minor crash will frustrate the player. A minor bump against the clouds will be tolerated, but you can only do this once every few minutes so that the complexity of the game is not compromised. This allows for the user to adjust the steering so that they don't crash again.

###	Internal levelling system:  
- The more miles phu covers, more are the number of obstacles he will have to avoid and the more fun it gets. Even though there is no explicit levelling system, internally the game gets harder as you cover more distance. This keeps the game interesting and keeps the user engaged.

###	Rewards: 
- The rewards are tailored around the number of miles the player is able to avoid obstacles and keep Phu airborne.
